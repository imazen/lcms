# Working on this port — read before your first change

Adapted from `zenav1-svt/rust/docs/WORKING-ON-THIS.md`; the same traps apply.

## The one-minute loop

```bash
cd rust && cargo test --workspace          # builds the C oracle once, then all gates
cargo test -p lcms --test c_parity_pcs     # one file's gate
```

The oracle rebuilds only when the submodule SHA changes (stamp in OUT_DIR).

## The loop for a new module

1. Read the C file. Port it into `crates/lcms/src/<module>.rs`, 1:1, with the
   C function names mapped in doc comments (`/// `cmsXYZ2Lab``).
2. Add extern decls to `lcms-cref/src/lib.rs` for every exported/`_cms` symbol
   you need to compare against. For `static`/`cmsINLINE` code, add a shim to
   `lcms-cref/shims/`.
3. Write `tests/c_parity_<module>.rs`: dense sweeps (deterministic xorshift,
   no rand dep), edge values, and **exhaustive** coverage wherever the domain
   allows it. Compare `to_bits()` — never epsilon-tolerance a parity claim.
4. A function the gate can't reach is not ported. Pin it or defer it — say which.

## Port discipline

- **1:1 with the C source.** Same operation order, same casts, same
  constants. Where C is wrong, be wrong the same way (lcms has few genuine
  bugs; record any in `docs/SUSPECTED-C-BUGS.md` and reproduce them).
- **No transcriptions of the oracle.** Never re-implement a C function on the
  *test* side; call the compiled symbol. Two transcriptions diverge.
- **`Option<&Context>` = `cmsContext`**, `None` = NULL (global context).
  Error paths that C reports via `cmsSignalError` go through `err::signal_error`
  — keep the exact condition, and note where C asserts vs returns.
- **Return `Option`/`bool` mirroring `cmsBool`+out-params.** Output structs
  are return values instead of `*mut` out-params — semantics unchanged.
- **`cmsAssert`**: in release C it compiles out. Port asserts that guard a
  real contract as `debug_assert!`; NULL checks the C performs unconditionally
  get ported as real checks.
- **Generate tables, never hand-transcribe.** `half_tables.rs` and
  `signatures.rs` come from `tools/gen_*.py`. Regenerate on rebase.

## Numeric traps (each cost a bug)

- `sin_cos()` — see PORTING.md: GCC merges `cos`/`sin` pairs into `sincos`.
- `pow(x, n)` lowering: `0.5`→sqrt, integer exps stay libm calls, const bases
  fold. `.powf(0.5)` vs `.sqrt()` both worked — but verify via the gate.
- `_cmsQuickFloor` is bit magic, not `floor()` (PORTING.md).
- `1.0/x`, `a/b*c` order matters; C precedence slips (e.g. a dropped paren in
  `pow(x,7) / (pow(x,7) + pow(25,7))` computing `1 + 25^7`) are caught only by
  the gate, not the compiler.
- NaN/Inf propagate differently through `as`-casts vs C casts.

## Evidence tiers — say which one you have in the commit message

1. differential vs the exported C symbol (standard), 2. byte-identity of
   whole outputs, 3. same-source shim, 4. hand-derived (state why nothing
   better exists).

## Adding a fix? Add its cell

Every divergence the gate catches is a candidate for a pinned regression cell.
Commit the failing input, not just the fix.

## Refusals

Where the port can't yet do what C does, return an error — never emit a
plausible-but-wrong result. Catalogue refusals in `docs/REFUSED.md` with what
C does for that input.
